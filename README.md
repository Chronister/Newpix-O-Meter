==============

This node.js app generates clock images based on the current time. It was originally created for the XKCD forum thread [1190: Time](http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=101043) which has a large and dedicated community that was originally devoted to keeping up with XKCD's [Time](http://xkcd.com/1190/) comic but now works on their own spin-offs and fan material. 

The project has 5 versions of the clock which were all ported from PHP code after my old web server went down. v1 is a simple black-and-white clock, v2 adds a colorful stopwatch image in the background, v3 adds rotating gear images, v4 is a "digital clock" variant (originally created to be a countdown, so it has odd formatting on the right where the date has long since past), and v5 is a larger mantle clock with a 4-hour face, a 1-hour face, and a half-hour face (to keep up with various cycles found in the thread, notably the 4-hour release cycle for one of the fan comics). Below you can see each version, hosted on [redhat's OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/).
